This document is based on the concepts outlined in the post  [Leetcode Patterns](https://www.blog.codeinmotion.io/p/leetcode-patterns) and provides a summarized interpretation prepared with the assistance of [Claude](https://claude.ai/).

# LeetCode Patterns: Easy to Hard Progression

## **EASY** (Start Here)
### 1. Two Pointers
- **Why Easy**: Simple concept, intuitive logic
- **Key Use**: Palindromes, removing duplicates, sorted arrays
- **Time Improvement**: O(N²) → O(N)

### 2. Binary Search
- **Why Easy**: Well-defined algorithm, clear conditions
- **Key Use**: Finding elements in sorted arrays
- **Time Improvement**: O(N) → O(log N)

### 3. Prefix Sum
- **Why Easy**: Straightforward array preprocessing
- **Key Use**: Range sum queries, subarray sums
- **Time Improvement**: O(N) per query → O(1) per query

## **EASY-MEDIUM**
### 4. Sliding Window
- **Why Easy-Medium**: Builds on two pointers, but requires window management
- **Key Use**: Subarray/substring problems with conditions
- **Time Improvement**: O(N²) → O(N)

### 5. Slow and Fast Pointers
- **Why Easy-Medium**: Simple concept but requires understanding of pointer speeds
- **Key Use**: Cycle detection, finding middle of linked list
- **Space Improvement**: O(N) → O(1)

### 6. Binary Tree Traversal
- **Why Easy-Medium**: Fundamental tree operations, good introduction to recursion
- **Key Use**: Tree processing, serialization, level-order operations

## **MEDIUM**
### 7. In Place Linked List Reversal
- **Why Medium**: Requires careful pointer manipulation
- **Key Use**: Reversing lists, reversing in groups
- **Space**: O(1) solution

### 8. Top K Elements
- **Why Medium**: Requires understanding heaps and priority queues
- **Key Use**: Finding largest/smallest K elements
- **Time Improvement**: O(N log N) → O(N log K)

### 9. Overlapping Intervals
- **Why Medium**: Requires sorting and merging logic
- **Key Use**: Meeting rooms, scheduling, range merging
- **Key Skill**: Interval manipulation

### 10. Bit Manipulation
- **Why Medium**: Requires understanding of binary operations
- **Key Use**: Missing numbers, addition without operators
- **Note**: Less common but powerful when needed

## **MEDIUM-HARD**
### 11. Monotonic Stack
- **Why Medium-Hard**: Requires understanding of stack properties and when to use them
- **Key Use**: Next greater/smaller element problems
- **Time Improvement**: O(N²) → O(N)

### 12. Graph and Matrices
- **Why Medium-Hard**: Multiple algorithms (DFS, BFS, topological sort)
- **Key Use**: Path finding, connectivity, ordering
- **Complexity**: Requires understanding of graph theory

## **HARD**
### 13. Dynamic Programming
- **Why Hard**: Requires identifying optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems
- **Key Use**: Optimization problems, counting problems
- **Time Improvement**: Exponential → Polynomial
- **Note**: Often the most challenging pattern to master

### 14. Backtracking
- **Why Hard**: Requires understanding recursion, pruning, and constraint satisfaction
- **Key Use**: Combinatorial problems, puzzles (Sudoku, N-Queens)
- **Complexity**: Can be exponential but with smart pruning

## **Learning Progression Tips**

### **Phase 1: Foundation (Easy)**
Master Two Pointers, Binary Search, and Prefix Sum first. These give you confidence and fundamental problem-solving skills.

### **Phase 2: Expansion (Easy-Medium)**
Add Sliding Window, Slow/Fast Pointers, and Tree Traversal. These build on your foundation.

### **Phase 3: Intermediate (Medium)**
Learn Top K Elements, Overlapping Intervals, Linked List Reversal, and Bit Manipulation. These introduce new data structures and concepts.

### **Phase 4: Advanced (Medium-Hard)**
Tackle Monotonic Stack and Graph problems. These require combining multiple concepts.

### **Phase 5: Expert (Hard)**
Master Dynamic Programming and Backtracking last. These are the most conceptually challenging.

## **Practice Strategy**
1. **Start with 2-3 easy problems per pattern** before moving to the next
2. **Don't rush** - ensure you understand the "why" behind each pattern
3. **Practice recognizing** when to use each pattern in new problems
4. **Review and revisit** patterns regularly to maintain proficiency
